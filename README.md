# php-di-container
A simple automatic dependency injection container implemented in PHP.

## Installation
To install this package, run the following command in your project root:
```bash
composer require Kyrill\PhpDiContainer
```
## Usage
### Create a container
You can create a container by instantiating the `Container` class.
```php
<?php
use Kyrill\PhpDiContainer\Container;
$container = new Container();
```

### Register a class

You donâ€™t have to register classes manually. All classes will be automatically resolved unless the constructor has an argument that is not a class.

#### Register a class with a function

You can register a class with a function by assigning it a unique name and providing a 'ClassDefinition' with constructor arguments, the class namespace, and whether it should be treated as a singleton (default is false). If no arguments are needed, you can pass an empty array.
```php
$container->register('name', new ClassDefinition(['argument1', 'argument2'], 'namespace\\classname/', true));
```

#### Register classes by a file

You can create a JSON file with the following structure to register classes, aliases, or interfaces:
```json
{
  "services": {
    "namespace\\classname": {
      "arguments": {
        "test": "\\Kyrill\\PhpDiContainer\\TestInterface",
        "foo": "bar"
      }
    },
    "namespace\\alias": {
      "class": "Kyrill\\PhpDiContainer\\Test",
      "arguments": {
        "test": "Kyrill\\PhpDiContainer\\TestInterface",
        "foo": "bar"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
You can use aliases to register classes or interfaces. Aliases are useful if you want to use a class or interface with a different name. For aliases and interfaces you have to use the `class` key. The `arguments` key is optional. If you want to use a class or interface without arguments.

##### Register file

To register the file you need to make a `ClassRegistar` class. You can register the file by using the `registerFile`
function. By default, there is a `JsonFileReader` class. This class reads a json file and registers the classes or
interfaces. But you can make your own `FileReader` class.
```php
$classRegister = new ClassRegistar();
$classRegister->registerFile('.\di.json', new JsonFileReader(), $container);
```

##### Make Your Own `FileReader`

To create your own `FileReader` class, implement the `FileReaderInterface`. This interface defines a single method:
`readFile()`. The method must return an array of classes, aliases, or interfaces.

The file must start with the keyword `services`, and all classes, aliases, or interfaces should be listed under it.

---

### Get a Class

You can retrieve a class using the `resolve` function. To resolve an alias, pass the alias namespace as a string, like this:
`'namespace\\alias'`.
```php
<?php
$container->resolve(Classname::class);
```
